# SkiWeather

SkiWeather is my first weather app created using Flutter, designed to provide you with up-to-date weather information. üå¶Ô∏è

## Overview

This app utilizes the power of the **OpenWeatherAPI** to fetch weather data for different cities. To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Get your API Key from OpenWeatherAPI:**
   - Visit [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for an API Key.

2. **Add your API Key to the project:**
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the `lib/utilities/constants.dart` file with the API Key you obtained.

3. **Run the Application:**
   - Open the project in your preferred Flutter development environment.
   - Build and run the application on your chosen platform.

## Features

SkiWeather offers the following features:

- **City-Based Weather Information:** Enter the name of a city, and SkiWeather will provide you with detailed weather information for that location.
